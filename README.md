## Technology Stack

### Backend

- .NET Core 8.0
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server
- JWT Authentication
- ASP.NET Core Web API

### Frontend

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Fabric.js for 2D canvas manipulation
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Azure Entra ID for authentication (with mock implementation for development)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (or SQL Server Express)
- Node.js and npm (optional, for frontend development)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/office-seating-plan.git
   cd office-seating-plan
   ```

2. Update connection string in `src/OfficeSeatingPlan.API/appsettings.json` to point to your SQL Server instance.

3. Apply database migrations:
   ```
   cd src/OfficeSeatingPlan.API
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. Run the API:
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

5. The API will be available at `https://localhost:44317` with Swagger documentation at `https://localhost:44317/swagger`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory (from the project root):
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser or serve it using a local web server.

   For example, using Python's built-in HTTP server:
   ```
   python -m http.server 3000
   ```

   Or using Node.js http-server:
   ```
   npm install -g http-server
   http-server -p 3000
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration

### Authentication

- For development, the application uses a mock authentication service by default.
- To use Azure Entra ID, update the following settings:
  - In `js/app.js`, set `this.config.useMockAuth` to `false`.
  - Update the client ID and authority in `auth-service.js`.

### API Endpoints

- The frontend is configured to connect to `https://localhost:44317/api` by default.
- To change the API URL, update the `apiBaseUrl` property in the configuration section of `app.js`.

### CORS

- CORS is configured in the backend to allow requests from `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:8080`, `http://localhost:5000`, and the production domain.
- If you're hosting the frontend at a different URL, update the `AllowedOrigins` array in `appsettings.json`.

## User Accounts

The application seeds the following users on first run:

- Admin User:
  - Email: admin@example.com
  - Password: Admin@123
  - Role: Admin

- Manager User:
  - Email: manager@example.com
  - Password: Manager@123
  - Role: Manager

- Regular User:
  - Email: user@example.com
  - Password: User@123
  - Role: User
